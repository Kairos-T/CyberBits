                        <h2 class="section-heading">Background: </h2>
                        <p> One year ago, as I embarked on my exploration of various sectors within ICT, I stumbled
                            upon a Red Canary webinar on persistence. At that point of time, the webinar's dense jargon
                             left me feeling adrift in a sea of technical terms. However, now that I have a deeper understanding 
                             of cybersecurity, I found myself drawn back to the webinar that had
                             previously eluded my grasp. Thus, this article is a complilation of the key insights I have gained (finally!)
                             from this webinar.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction: </h2>
                        
                        <p>Adversaries can sustain unauthorised access to infiltrated systems thanks to persistence
                             mechanisms, but they also provide opportunities for detection. In this article,
                              we examine the importance of persistence in cybersecurity and how businesses can 
                              use detection techniques to effectively combat these attacks.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding Persistence and its Importance: </h2>

                        <p>The ability of an attacker to be able to continue exploiting a compromised asset is 
                            referred to as persistence. They are able to carry on despite intermittent
                             disruptions and regain access even after being found and ejected from a network because of it.
                              To accomplish their objectives, which include data collection and lateral movement inside the 
                              compromised system, adversaries rely on persistence.</p>
                        
                        

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Common Persistence Mechanisms Explored in MITRE ATT&CK: </h2>

                        <p>The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists a variety of persistence approaches to use in 
                            Windows, Linux, and macOS environments. Webshells, WMI event subscriptions,
                             registry run keys, and the use of legitimate accounts are a few common techniques.
                              Since adversaries frequently employ many persistence strategies concurrently,
                               thorough coverage is essential for efficient detection.</p>
                    
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Detection Opportunities and Best Practices: </h2>
                        <p>Detecting persistence requires a multi-faceted approach.
                             Some recommended practices include:</p>
                             <ol>
                                <li><strong>PowerShell Logging</strong>: Makes it easier to spot suspicious activity and encoded commands, giving information
                                    on tasks related to persistence.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Sysmon and PowerShell CLI</strong>: Organisations can examine parent command lines and binary launches using
                                Sysmon and PowerShell's CLI, assisting in the disccovery of persistence activities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sysinternals Autoruns</strong>: Sysinternals usage Administrators can use Autoruns 
                                    to look for auto-run entries throughout the system, assisting in the discovery of malicious
                                     persistence techniques.</li>
                                <li><strong>OSQuery</strong>: Utilising OSQuery's built-in WMI queries makes it easier to identify malicious 
                                    WMI objects quickly, improving response times.</li>
                                <li><strong>Anti Malware Scan Interface (AMSI)</strong>: The detection and prevention of malicious activity within persistent scripts
                                     are made possible by AMSI integration with security systems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</strong>The use of an EDR solution offers thorough visibility into persistence 
                                    strategies, assisting in the monitoring and analysis of threats connected to persistence.</li>
                              </ol>
                        <p>If that didn't make sense to you, here are some explanations on the jargon:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sysmon</strong> is a Windows system monitoring tool developed by Microsoft that provides detailed visibility into system activities and helps detect and analyse security-related events.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sysinternals Autoruns</strong> is a Windows utility that allows users to view and manage programs, processes, services, drivers, and other startup items to optimise system performance and troubleshoot issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>OSQuery</strong> is an open-source, cross-platform framework that enables SQL-based querying of operating system and system-level data, providing a unified interface for monitoring, analysis, and security purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)</strong> is a management infrastructure in Windows that allows administrators to gather information, perform system tasks, and automate management tasks on local and remote systems.</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Adapting to Cloud Environments and Knowledge Sharing: </h2>
                        <p>Adapting detection strategies for persistence becomes increasingly important as businesses move to cloud settings. Comprehensive protection
                             is ensured by using a flexible strategy and relying on security tools designed specifically for 
                             the cloud. Through webinars, conferences, and industry forums, the cybersecurity community can 
                             collaborate and share expertise to develop defense tactics against persistence-based attacks.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: </h2>
                        <p>Although persistence strategies give attackers the upper hand, 
                            they also give room for discovery. Organisations can improve
                             their ability to recognise threats and respond to them by using a variety 
                             of detection techniques and understanding common persistence mechanisms. 
                             Maintaining alertness, adjusting to new technologies, and promoting cooperation 
                             within the cybersecurity community are all components of an effective defence strategy. 
                             The capacity to recognise persistence strengthens the security of digital assets by 
                             exposing the actions of adversaries.</p>
