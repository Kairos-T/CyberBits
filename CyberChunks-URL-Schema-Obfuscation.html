                            <h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>

                        <p>In the constantly evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, attackers
                            are continuously looking for novel ways to get around security measures and exploit vulnerabilities.
                        One such method that has been gaining popularity is URL Schema Obfuscation. <br><br> URL Schema Obfuscation
                        includes misusing the URL schema to obfuscate a URL's end destination. This blog post covers
                    notions of URL Schema Obfuscation, its consequences in cybersecurity, and the necessity for efficient
                    detection and prevention.</p>

                             <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding URL Schema and Obfuscation</h2>
                        <p>The addresses used to find information on the internet are called URLs (Uniform Resource
                            Locators). They adhere to a particular format that is described in RFC1738.
                            For instance, the format for an HTTP URL is "http://host:port/path?searchpart". The portion of the URL
                             schema, such as "http://" or "https://," defines the protocol or scheme used to access the resource.
                            <br><br> In order to fool victim's and avoid discovery, URL Schema Obfuscation leverages the URL schema's structure and
                            constituent parts. One of the techniques often employed involves inserting an "@" sign
                            in the URL, specifically in the username section.
                        </p>


                              <h2 class="section-heading">Obfuscating the destination server using the "@" Sign</h2>
                                <p>Inserting a "@" symbol in the URL, notably in the username area,
                                    is one method used in URL Schema Obfuscation.
                                    The username section is indicated in the URL format before
                                    the "@" sign, but browsers normally ignore it.
                                    Attackers benefit from this behaviour by changing the username
                                    component of the URL to the target email domain, which makes the URL
                                    look more legitimate, particularly for spear-phishing campaigns.
                                    <br><br>
                                    An authentic URL might resemble- "http://username:password@example.com/path/file",
                                    where "example.com" designates the server's location.
                                    The attacker would substitute the email domain for the username section
                                    in an obfuscated URL, creating "http://example.com/path/file". Due to
                                    this alteration, the URL appears to be a genuine one, which increases the
                                     likelihood that victims may fall for the phishing scam.</p>

                                     <h2 class="section-heading">Implications</h2>
                                     <p>URL Schema Obfuscation presents substantial difficulties for network defenders
                                         and security technology. Attackers can circumvent security mechanisms
                                         that rely on knowing which server a URL points to by exploiting the URL
                                         structure, potentially resulting in gaps in visibility and coverage. When
                                         traditional URL parsing logic encounters these encoded URLs, visibility
                                         into threat campaigns and actor infrastructure is lost.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Furthermore, the method boosts the success of phishing attempts (and more specifically, spear-phishing attempts)
                                         because victims are more likely to trust URLs that look like legitimate domains.
                                         Attackers might increase the success rate of their
                                         campaigns by exploiting URL Schema Obfuscation, jeopardising the
                                          security of individuals and organisations alike.</p>

                                     <h2 class="section-heading">Detection and Prevention</h2>
                                     <p>Schema for Addressing URLs Obfuscation necessitates proactive
                                        network defence measures.
                                        They should look for "@" indications in URLs' username
                                         sections and scrutinise URLs that lack an appropriate
                                         username-password combination. It is also critical to
                                         have URL parsing methods that can handle alternate hostname
                                          forms and recognise non-standard IP address representations.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To properly detect and prevent obfuscated URLs, security
                                         solutions such as web gateways, email filters, and endpoint protection
                                         systems should be equipped with extensive URL analysis capabilities.
                                         Furthermore, user education and awareness programmes are critical in
                                          reducing the risks connected with URL-based assaults.</p>

                                     <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                                    <p>URL Schema Obfuscation is a developing malware delivery technique that uses the URL
                                        schema to conceal a URL's true destination. Attackers mislead victims,
                                         avoid detection, and boost the success rate of their attacks by putting
                                          "@" marks in the username field. Understanding the complexities of URL
                                           Schema Obfuscation is critical for network defenders in order to design
                                           effective detection and prevention measures to protect persons and o
                                           rganisations from developing cyber threats. We can collectively
                                           reinforce our defences against URL-based attacks and reduce their
                                           influence on the cybersecurity landscape by remaining vigilant and
                                           implementing proper security measures.</p>
