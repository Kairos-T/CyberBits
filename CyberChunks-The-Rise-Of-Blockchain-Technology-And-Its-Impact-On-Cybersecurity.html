                        <p>One of the most widely discussed topics in the technological sector
                             in recent years is blockchain technology. 
                             It’s technology has advanced quickly and has begun to have a big 
                             impact on different industries. Cybersecurity is one of the areas where 
                             blockchain technology has proven promising prospects.
                            <br> <br>
                            But before we delve deeper into the rise of blockchain technology and its impact
                            on cybersecurity, we shall start with some basic theory. 
                            
                            <br> <br>What is Blockchain Technology? <br><br>
                            
                            Blockchain is a decentralised, distributed database 
                            that securely and immutably stores data and records transactions. 
                            The technology is renowned for its capacity to offer trust, 
                            security, and transparency in a distributed network.

                            <h2 class="section-heading">Rise of Blockchain Technology</h2>
                     
                        <p>With the launch of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2009, 
                            blockchain technology became increasingly popular. Since then, 
                            technology has advanced quickly, leading to the emergence of 
                            numerous new cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Dogecoin, 
                            and Tether.
                            <br><br>
                             In addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology 
                             has found use in a number of industries, such as voting systems, 
                             healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>

                             <h2 class="section-heading">Impact of Blockchain Technology in Cybersecurity</h2>
                        <p>The blockchain is a secure and dependable system for data storage
                             and transmission because of its decentralised and distributed 
                             nature. The cybersecurity landscape is changing in a number of 
                             ways thanks to blockchain technology, including the following:</p>
                        
                             <h3>1. Decentralised Security</h3>
                             <p>Traditional cybersecurity systems rely on a central authority or server
                                 to secure data, making them centralised systems. They are therefore 
                                 susceptible to data leaks and cyberattacks.
                                 <br><br>
                                However, because blockchain technology is decentralised, 
                                data is saved and validated across a number of network nodes. 
                                Hackers will find it considerably more difficult to access the
                                 system and steal information as a result.</p>

                             <h3>2. Immutable Data Keeping</h3>
                                <p>Once a block is uploaded to the blockchain, it cannot be changed 
                                    or removed due to blockchain technology. As a result, the 
                                    blockchain is a perfect tool for record-keeping because
                                     it makes data unchangeable and impervious to tampering.
                                     <br><br>
                                    Blockchain technology can thus be applied to processes 
                                    like financial transactions, where data integrity is essential.</p>
                             <h3>3. Cryptographic Security</h3>
                                <p>Advanced cryptography methods are used by blockchain technology to 
                                    secure data. This encompasses digital signatures, hashing, and public-key
                                     cryptography.
                                     <br><br>
                                    Hackers are unable to alter data on the blockchain as a result of these 
                                    encryption methods.</p>
                              <h3>4. Smart Contacts</h3>
                              <p>In smart contracts, the details of the agreement between the buyer and seller
                                 are directly encoded into lines of code. These contracts self-execute. 
                                 When specific circumstances are met, they automatically carry out since 
                                 they are kept on the blockchain.
                                 <br><br>
                                The danger of human mistake can be decreased by 
                                automating complicated procedures like supply chain management.</p>
