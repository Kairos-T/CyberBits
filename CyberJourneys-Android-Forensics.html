                        <h2 class="section-heading">Background: </h2>
                        <p> At the beginning of this month (5 May 2023), 
                            I had the opportunity to participate in the Magnet User Summit CTF 
                            organised by Magnet Forensics. One of the challenges that caught my attention
                             was the Android Forensics category. At that point, I was just 
                             starting to delve into the world of Cybersecurity, and I wasn't very familiar 
                             with forensics. Instead of relying on specialised tools,
                              I primarily worked with the raw data provided in the Logical Data.
                            <br><br>
                            But now, things have changed! 
                            I've become more acquainted with forensics tools like ALEAPP, and 
                            I've gained a deeper understanding of their capabilities. 
                            In this blog post, I'll be sharing my experiences and documenting the findings 
                            I've made using these tools.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction: </h2>
                        
                        <p>Adversaries can sustain unauthorised access to infiltrated systems thanks to persistence
                             mechanisms, but they also provide opportunities for detection. In this article,
                              we examine the importance of persistence in cybersecurity and how businesses can 
                              use detection techniques to effectively combat these attacks.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Finding Device Information </h2>

                        <p>When conducting Android forensics (be it for this CTF or not :P ), one of the crucial aspects
                            is gathering device information. Using ALEAPP, I could analyse the system logs, databases and 
                            other artifacts. <br><br> Here is an example of the usage of ALEAPP to find the information of 
                            the device:
                            
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/device_info.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the device information of the Android system  " />
                        
                        <p>And this was conveniently the solution for a few CTF challenges too! These pieces of information
                            was found in the index.html file of the data after being processed by ALEAPP.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Finding Account Data</h2>

                        <p>In the realm of Android forensics, uncovering account data can be of paramount importance.
                            This can encompass information related to accounts (email addresses, usernames, associated services, etc.)
                            , providing insights into the user's digital footprint. <br><br>
                            Through the Accounts_ce report function of the ALEAPP processed data, I could find the twitter handle
                            and an e-mail account.

                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/account_report.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the account information found  " />
                    
                        <p>To dive further in, the processed data also has information on the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Queued Messages
                            of the user's twitter activity such as tweets.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="assets/img/androidforensics/tweets_fcm_dump.png" alt="
                        Image showcasing the account information found  " />


                        <h2 class="section-heading">Battery Percentage Information </h2>
                        <p>I was pretty surprised to discover that there was actually data associated with
                            battery percentages in Android devices, and I didn't think that there was any significance of this 
                            seemingly mundane piece of information.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, upon further research, I found out that </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Adapting to Cloud Environments and Knowledge Sharing: </h2>
                        <p>Adapting detection strategies for persistence becomes increasingly important as businesses move to cloud settings. Comprehensive protection
                             is ensured by using a flexible strategy and relying on security tools designed specifically for 
                             the cloud. Through webinars, conferences, and industry forums, the cybersecurity community can 
                             collaborate and share expertise to develop defense tactics against persistence-based attacks.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: </h2>
                        <p>Although persistence strategies give attackers the upper hand, 
                            they also give room for discovery. Organisations can improve
                             their ability to recognise threats and respond to them by using a variety 
                             of detection techniques and understanding common persistence mechanisms. 
                             Maintaining alertness, adjusting to new technologies, and promoting cooperation 
                             within the cybersecurity community are all components of an effective defence strategy. 
                             The capacity to recognise persistence strengthens the security of digital assets by 
                             exposing the actions of adversaries.</p>
